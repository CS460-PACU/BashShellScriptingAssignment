An introduction to the formal techniques that support the design and 
analysis of algorithms, focusing on both the underlying mathematical 
theory and the practical considerations of efficiency. Topics include 
asymptotic complexity bounds, techniques of analysis, algorithmic strategies, 
advanced data structures, graph theory and other selected topics. 
Coursework includes object-oriented programming in C++ and covers 
templates, STL, and exception handling. Prerequisite: CS 300 and 
MATH 240 each with a minimum grade of C. Offered alternate years. 4 credits.
