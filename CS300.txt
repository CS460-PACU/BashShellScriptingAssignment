Data structures are fundamental to advanced, efficient programming. Topics 
including asymptotic analysis, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hash 
tables, searching and sorting will be covered in discussions centering 
around more sophisticated programming concepts and problem solving 
techniques. Prerequisite: CS 250 with a minimum grade of C. 4 credits.
