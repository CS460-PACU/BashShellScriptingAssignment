This course is an introduction to the mathematical foundations of the 
theory of computation. We will study automata theory, formal languages, 
the theory of computability and undecidability, and computational complexity. 
This material is central to many branches of computer science; it underlies 
the basic theory of compiler design, the efficiency of algorithms, and the 
limitations of computing.
